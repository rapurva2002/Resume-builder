# Resume-builder

# Problem Statement:
Implementing a Web Application to create resumes by asking user to fill simple forms where important credentials are required. 

A  resume is a document that contains a summary or listing of relevant job experience  and education. The list of qualifications or CV is normally the principal thing that a potential business experiences with respect to the work searcher and is regularly used to screen candidates, frequently followed by a meeting, when looking for business. 
A resume builder is an online tool that you can use to quickly create a resume. Resume builders allow you to pick a pre-formatted resume template, fill in your contact and background information, and select pre-written work history bullet points — saving you a lot of time.


# Scope:
Customers can utilise online resume builders to create resumes that meet their needs. Customers can personalise their resumes by choosing from a variety of themes and elements.


# Motivation:
A resume (or “CV” outside of the US) is a formal document that provides an overview of your professional qualifications, including your relevant work experience, skills, education, and notable accomplishments. They are generally used when trying to get a job or an internship. Unfortunately, Recruiters spend 5 to 7 seconds on average going over resumes and 76% of the resumes are rejected due to an unprofessional email address, thus, a single typo on your resume can take your dream job away. That's why using a resume builder is more efficient way of creating resumes.
