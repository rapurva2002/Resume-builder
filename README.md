# Resume-builder
A  resume is a document that contains a summary or listing of relevant job experience  and education. The list of qualifications or CV is normally the principal thing that a potential business experiences with respect to the work searcher and is regularly used to screen candidates, frequently followed by a meeting, when looking for business. 
A resume builder is an online tool that you can use to quickly create a resume. Resume builders allow you to pick a pre-formatted resume template, fill in your contact and background information, and select pre-written work history bullet points â€” saving you a lot of time.
